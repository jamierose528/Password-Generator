# Password-Generator

## Description

I created a password generator that meets the needs of any user to meet any password requirement, from 8 to 128 characters.

There are prompts for options including special characters, numbers, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters.

## User Story
 
Click "generate passport" and some prompt alerts will come up for the user to choose parameters for the password to have. Once all the prompts are answered, a password will appear in the text box for the user to copy and use as their new password!
